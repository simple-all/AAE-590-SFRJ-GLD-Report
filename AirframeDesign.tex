For mass and volume sizing purposes, Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and Power units were investigated for the GLD. The GLD can be controlled by a small logic board, for example an ODROID-XU4, which has DC Voltage 5 V and weighs merely 1.5 oz. Power can be supplied by a Lithium Polymer (LiPO) battery pack, for example the Tenergy 900 mAh 7.4 V 25C LiPO Battery, which weighs approximately 1.6 oz. Transformers and wiring would be included as necessary and are estimated to weigh approximately 3 oz. This GNC and Power design should allow approximately three minutes minimum operational time with fully loaded actuators, which is plenty for our GLD, whose SFRJ stage burns for nearly 30 s.
